## Insiders build

#### What is it?

The Insiders build is a way for you (the consumer) to try and test out features in VS Code that haven't been released yet

#### Get the Insiders build

Download and install the Insiders build [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders). It will install seperately from the normal releases allowing you to preview and test new features without affecting your "normal" installation.  

__Note:__ If you were previously using "updateChannel": "insiders" to get early builds you will need to manually download the Insiders build in order to keep testing the latest and greatest of VS Code. Your current build will upgrade to the latest stable release.
